If the attribute has multiple values, provide them as a list in this format: ["value1", "value2", "value3"].
If the attribute requires providing a description or free-form text, the value of the attribute must contain this text.
Note that some attributes are not directly stated in the document, but their values are implicitly defined in the text.
Do your best to extract a full value for each requested attribute from the document.
If provided, you must also follow the additional instructions in <instructions></instructions>.

I would like to apologize for the delay in the delivery of the ordered goods. Unfortunately, there was a delay due to a technical problem in our warehouse.
Your order 754263 has now been shipped and you should receive the goods within the next 2-3 business days. I ask for your understanding regarding these inconveniences.
Kind regards,
Nikita Schulz

2. shipment_delay_complaint: whether the email is from a customer complaining about shipment delays
3. urgency_score: how soon we should react to the customer email on a scale from 0 to 1
</attributes>

Output:
<thinking>
The document mentions the customer name in the email signature: Nikita Schulz. In the email, the customer is complaining about shipment delays. There are no data points that indicate very high urgency, so I will assign a neutral score of 0.5/
